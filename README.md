# Library Management Interface

This project is a simple library management interface built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to add books with details such as book name, author, and number of pages. The added books are stored locally using localStorage so that they persist even after the page is refreshed.

## Features

- **Add Book:** Click the "Add Book" button to open a form where you can enter details about a new book.
- **Save Book:** Enter the book's name, author, and number of pages, then click "Save" to add the book to the library.
- **View Library:** All added books are displayed in a grid format with their details.
- **Responsive Design:** The interface is designed to be responsive, adapting to different screen sizes.

3. Use the "Add Book" button to add new books to your library.

4. Close the form by clicking the close button (X) or outside the form to return to the main interface.
